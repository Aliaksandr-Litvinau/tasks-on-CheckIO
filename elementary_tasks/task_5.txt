You have a sequence of strings, and youâ€™d like to determine the most frequently occurring string in the sequence. It can be only one.

Input: non empty list of strings.

Output: a string.

Example:

most_frequent([
    'a', 'b', 'c',
    'a', 'b',
    'a'
]) == 'a'
most_frequent(['a', 'a', 'bi', 'bi', 'bi']) == 'bi'
